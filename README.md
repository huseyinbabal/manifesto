# Manifesto
 
### Main Motivation
The main motivation of this organization to help **Software Engineer candidates** to become **familiar about software development industry** to **eliminate stress** and help them for **building their career on their own**.

### How it works
- New application periods are announced on [twitter](https://twitter.com/huseyinbabal) periodically. So, candidate applies to that form.
- 10 members are selected out of that list and they are all invited to **livecodingturkey** github organization. 
- Weekly meetings to talk about software development methodologies by using Java or Go
- After covering basic concepts, one or two open source idea(s) is introduced and 10 members contribute to those projects to learn OSS contribution lifecycles.
- Encourage each member to provide a talk to community about any topic they choose.
- Repeat this cycle (e.g. per 6 months)


### Expected outcome of this sessions
- Candidate better understands Programming Language concepts
- Candidate has better tooling to develop software, like using Shortcuts within IDE, using Github Actions for CI/CD, even using Kubernetes for application deployment
- Meetings will be in English (this is not something mandatory, but strongly suggested) to prepare members for international companies, freelance work, etc... It is ok not being fluent, since we believe at the end of 5-6 months, you will have better English communication skills in software development domain.
- Candidate will have communication skills to talk about their experience in the community.
- Candidate will improve live coding skills.
